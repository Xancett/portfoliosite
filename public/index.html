            <p>
                Experienced software developer with 14 years of experience working with computers.
                Intrinsically motivated for self-education and known for taking on complex problems that require creative solutions.
                I left highschool with experience in Visual Basic, C++ and Java and spent years afterwards working on various projects.
                I started a company to create video games and have since released a mobile puzzle game for iOS and Android with over 30 thousand levels.
                I wrote all of the code in the game including a custom level creator and solver designed to create unique and interesting levels.
                I've recently been building web apps using a variety of languages and frameworks.

            <p><b>Info: </b>
                Hangman game designed to focus on nodejs as well as a NoSQL database.
                The game allows you to play through a round with a randomly chosen word from my database.
                The word is never stored client-side to prevent cheating.
                When the game is over the win or loss is recorded and stored in the database as well.
                The stats and summary page is for viewing interesting stats pulled from the database about the games that have been played.

                This website is currently running on a micro virtual machine instance on Google's cloud platform.
                It runs NodeJS with express to deliver web content.
                This VM also runs MongoDB in the back end and hosts the hangman game linked above.
                The frontend code is available on github but the backend server is not.

                This is a script I wrote in my free time for a previous job.
                This script takes the first and last name of someone and uses the BeautifulSoup4 api to traverse the directory.
                Once the employee is found, their name and email is saved in a text file for use later.
                I wrote this to cut down on how much work was required before I could send out an email to multiple people in a list.

            <p>
                Experienced software developer with 14 years of experience working with computers.
                Intrinsically motivated for self-education and known for taking on complex problems that require creative solutions.
                I left highschool with experience in Visual Basic, C++ and Java and spent years afterwards working on various projects.
                I started a company to create video games and have since released a mobile puzzle game for iOS and Android with over 30 thousand levels.
                I wrote all of the code in the game including a custom level creator and solver designed to create unique and interesting levels.
                I've recently started learning html, css and javascript as well as some nodejs.

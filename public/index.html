            <p>
                Experienced software developer with 14 years of experience working with computers.
                Intrinsically motivated for self-education and known for taking on complex problems that require creative solutions.
                I left highschool with experience in Visual Basic, C++ and Java and spent years afterwards working on various projects.
                I started a company to create video games and have since released a mobile puzzle game for iOS and Android with over 30 thousand levels.
                I wrote all of the code in the game including a custom level creator and solver designed to create unique and interesting levels.
                I've recently started learning html, css and javascript as well as some nodejs.

                        Built from scratch with a custom level generator and solver to ensure each level is unique and interesting.
                        Over 30,000 unique and engaging puzzles designed to challenge the mind.
                        Arrow-Shift was built in an open source engine Godot (written in c++).

                        A writeup on how I built the level generator and solver can be found here (link).

                            Description: Hangman game designed to focus on nodejs as well as a NoSQL database.
                            The game allows you to play through a round with a randomly chosen word from my database.
                            The word is never stored client-side to prevent cheating.
                            When the game is over the win or loss is recorded and stored in the database as well.
                            The stats and summary page is for viewing interesting stats pulled from the database about the games that have been played.

                            You can view a diagram of the design process here (linK).

                            This script takes the first and last name of someone and uses the BeautifulSoup4 api to traverse the directory.
                            Once the employee is found, their name and email is saved in a text file for use later.
                            I wrote this to cut down on how much work was required before I could send out an email to multiple people in a list.
